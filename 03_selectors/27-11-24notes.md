3. input type=text is called attribute
   every browser has its own css like h1 bigger than h6 also some paddding usually we flush it because tailwind does it

  margin does orund the whole text has clockwise
  padding: 1px 2px 3px; this is also clockwise t lefr right bottowm
  we can also only add margin to bottom margin-bottom: 10px ;
